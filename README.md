# SWTriviaBot

A trivia bot project governed by constitutional principles ensuring quality, reliability, and user experience excellence.

## Project Constitution

This project follows a formal constitution that defines our core development principles and governance model. The full constitution is maintained in [`.specify/memory/constitution.md`](.specify/memory/constitution.md).

### Core Principles

1. **Code Quality**: All code must be readable, maintainable, and purpose-driven with mandatory static analysis, documentation, and complexity controls.

2. **Testing Standards**: Comprehensive automated testing at all levels (unit, integration, regression) with 85% statement coverage and 90% coverage for critical paths.

3. **User Experience Consistency**: Unified tone, formatting, and accessibility standards across all user-facing interactions.

4. **Performance Requirements**: Defined performance budgets (p95 < 200ms for interactive actions, memory < 100MB per process) with benchmark-driven validation.

### Development Workflow

We follow a structured workflow: **Plan → Spec → Tasks → Implement → Review → Merge → Release → Observe**

Each phase includes constitutional gates that ensure compliance with our core principles.

### Getting Started

Documentation and specifications are organized under the `.specify/` directory:

- **Constitution**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- **Templates**: `.specify/templates/` (plan, spec, tasks)
- **Feature Specs**: `specs/` (created per feature)

For detailed governance rules, amendment procedures, and compliance review processes, see the full constitution document.

## Contributing

All contributions must adhere to the constitutional principles. PRs must include:

- Tests written first (Red-Green-Refactor)
