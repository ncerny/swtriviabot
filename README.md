A Discord bot for managing trivia game answers with slash commands. Players submit answers, admins view and reset sessions.

## Features

- **Submit Answers**: Users submit answers via `/answer` command with duplicate detection
- **View Submissions**: Admins list all answers with `/list-answers` command
- **Reset Sessions**: Admins clear all answers with `/reset-answers` command
- **Multi-Server Support**: Isolated session state per Discord server
- **Persistent Storage**: Session data saved to disk for durability

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.14 or higher
- Discord bot token ([Get one here](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- Discord bot invited to your server with:
  - `applications.commands` scope
  - `bot` scope with `Send Messages` permission

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ncerny/swtriviabot.git
   cd swtriviabot
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your bot token:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
   ```

4. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python src/bot.py
   ```

### Discord Bot Setup

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click "New Application" and name it
3. Go to "Bot" section and click "Add Bot"
4. Under "Token", click "Copy" to get your bot token
5. Save the token in your `.env` file as `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`
6. Go to "OAuth2 â†’ URL Generator"
7. Select scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
8. Select permissions: `Send Messages`
9. Copy the generated URL and open it in a browser to invite the bot

## Usage

### Player Commands

**`/answer [text]`** - Submit your answer to the current question

Example:

```
/answer The capital of France is Paris
```

Response on first submission:

```
âœ… Your answer has been recorded!
```

Response on updating your answer:

```
ðŸ”„ You've already answered this question - updating your answer!
```

**Notes:**

- Responses are private (only you can see them)
- You can update your answer as many times as you want
- Only your most recent answer is saved
- Answer length limited to 4000 characters

### Admin Commands (requires Administrator permission)

**`/list-answers`** - View all submitted answers

Example response:

```
ðŸ“‹ **Submitted Answers:**

1. **Player1**: The capital of France is Paris
2. **Player2**: Paris, France
3. **Player3**: Paris
```

When no answers submitted:

```
ðŸ“‹ No answers submitted yet
```

**`/reset-answers`** - Clear all answers and start fresh

Example response:

```
ðŸ”„ All answers have been reset - ready for next question!
```

**Notes:**

- Only users with Administrator permission can use these commands
- `/reset-answers` permanently deletes all session data
- After reset, users can submit new answers

---

## Troubleshooting

### Bot is offline

- Check bot token is correct in `.env` file
- Verify bot process is running: `ps aux | grep bot.py`
- Check logs for error messages

### Commands not appearing

- Bot needs `applications.commands` scope when invited
- Wait up to 1 hour for commands to sync globally
- Try restarting the bot to trigger command sync

### Permission errors

- Admin commands require Administrator permission in Discord
- Regular `/answer` command works for all users
- Check bot has "Send Messages" permission in channel

### Answers not persisting

- Verify `/data/` directory exists and is writable
- Check disk space: `df -h`
- Look for "Saved X session(s)" messages in logs

### Bot crashes or restarts

- Check memory usage: `free -h`
- Review error logs for Python exceptions
- Ensure Python 3.14+ is installed: `python3 --version`

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:

### Before Contributing

1. Read the [constitution](.specify/memory/constitution.md) for code quality standards
2. Check existing issues and pull requests
3. Open an issue to discuss major changes

### Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. Write tests first (Red-Green-Refactor)
4. Implement your changes
5. Run tests and linting: `pytest && flake8 src/`
6. **Use conventional commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, etc.
   - `feat: add new command` â†’ Minor version bump
   - `fix: correct answer validation` â†’ Patch version bump
   - `feat!: change API` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` â†’ Major version bump
7. Push changes and create a pull request
   - All PRs are automatically tested (see badge above)
   - Tests must pass with â‰¥80% coverage
8. Wait for review and address feedback

### Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automatic semantic versioning:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature (minor version bump)
- `fix`: Bug fix (patch version bump)
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement (patch version bump)
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Breaking Changes:**
- Add `!` after type: `feat!: redesign command interface`
- Or include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer (major version bump)

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add /leaderboard command"
git commit -m "fix: prevent duplicate submissions in same second"
git commit -m "docs: update deployment instructions"
git commit -m "feat!: change answer storage format

BREAKING CHANGE: Answer format changed from string to object"
```

### Release Process

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions:
1. PRs are tested automatically (PR Tests workflow)
2. Merging to `main` triggers semantic-release (Release workflow)
3. Version is calculated from conventional commits
4. Release notes are auto-generated
5. Production artifact is attached to release (Artifact workflow)
6. Format code: `black src/ tests/`
7. Commit with conventional commit message: `feat: add new feature`
8. Push and create pull request

### Pull Request Requirements

- âœ… All tests passing
- âœ… Code coverage â‰¥85% (90% for critical paths)
- âœ… No linter errors (flake8)
- âœ… Code formatted with black
- âœ… Type hints verified with mypy

    â”œâ”€â”€ validators.py        # Input validation
    â””â”€â”€ formatters.py        # Message formatting
```

### Data Flow

1. **Answer Submission**: User â†’ Discord â†’ `/answer` command â†’ answer_service â†’ storage_service â†’ disk
2. **List Answers**: Admin â†’ Discord â†’ `/list-answers` command â†’ answer_service â†’ formatters â†’ Discord
3. **Reset Session**: Admin â†’ Discord â†’ `/reset-answers` command â†’ answer_service â†’ storage_service â†’ disk cleanup

### Storage Model

- **In-memory cache**: `dict[guild_id, TriviaSession]` for fast access
- **Disk persistence**: JSON files in `/data/{guild_id}.json` for durability
- **Hybrid approach**: Read from disk on startup, write on every change

## Repository Configuration

### Recommended Branch Protection (main branch)

To ensure code quality and automated releases work correctly, configure the following branch protection rules:

1. **Go to**: Repository Settings â†’ Branches â†’ Branch protection rules â†’ Add rule
2. **Branch name pattern**: `main`
3. **Enable**:
   - âœ… Require a pull request before merging
     - Require approvals: 1 (or more for larger teams)
   - âœ… Require status checks to pass before merging
     - Require branches to be up to date before merging
     - **Required status checks**: `Run Tests` (from PR Tests workflow)
   - âœ… Require conversation resolution before merging
   - âœ… Do not allow bypassing the above settings (for admins)
4. **Save changes**

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents untested code from reaching main
- Ensures all PRs have passing tests before merge
- Triggers automatic releases only for tested code
- Enforces conventional commit messages through PR review

**Workflow Monitoring:**
- PR Tests workflow must pass (â‰¥80% coverage)
- Release workflow runs automatically on merge to main
- Artifact workflow attaches deployment-ready files to release
- Check Actions tab for workflow execution status
