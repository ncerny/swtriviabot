# Implementation Plan: GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflows

**Branch**: `002-github-actions-cicd` | **Date**: October 25, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-github-actions-cicd/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature implements automated CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions to ensure code quality through automated testing on pull requests and automate release management with semantic versioning. The primary goals are: (1) execute comprehensive test suites on every PR with coverage enforcement, (2) automatically create versioned GitHub releases when code is merged to main, and (3) generate optimized production artifacts excluding test files and development dependencies. The technical approach uses GitHub Actions workflows triggered by PR events and push events to main, leveraging existing pytest infrastructure and conventional commit parsing for semantic versioning.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.14+ (existing project standard)  
**Primary Dependencies**: GitHub Actions (workflow automation), pytest 8.4.2+ with pytest-cov 7.0.0+ (testing), conventional commit parser (semantic versioning)  
**Storage**: GitHub Actions artifacts (build logs, test results), GitHub Releases (release metadata and deployment artifacts)  
**Testing**: pytest with pytest-asyncio 1.2.0+ for Discord bot testing (already established)  
**Target Platform**: GitHub-hosted runners (ubuntu-latest) matching production environment  
**Project Type**: Single Python application (Discord bot) with established src/ structure  
**Performance Goals**: Test execution <5 minutes, release creation <2 minutes, artifact generation <1 minute  
**Constraints**: 80% minimum test coverage (established), GitHub Actions free tier limits (2000 minutes/month for private repos), artifact size <2GB  
**Scale/Scope**: ~400 lines of production code, 67 tests, single repository, multiple workflows (PR testing, release automation, artifact creation)

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### Code Quality

- [x] Static analysis configured (linter, formatter) - **Status**: Already established (.flake8, pyproject.toml exist)
- [x] Documentation standards defined for public interfaces - **Status**: Already established (docstrings in src/)
- [x] Complexity thresholds identified (cyclomatic complexity ≤10 or justified) - **Status**: Constitution requires ≤10, enforced in reviews

### Testing Standards

- [x] Test strategy defined (unit/integration/regression levels) - **Status**: Already established (tests/unit/, tests/integration/)
- [x] Coverage thresholds established (85% statements, 90% critical paths) - **Status**: Already established (.coveragerc with 80% minimum, current at 86.92%)
- [x] Red-Green-Refactor workflow planned for new features - **Status**: Already established practice per constitution

### User Experience Consistency

- [x] UX patterns and terminology defined - **Status**: Not applicable - CI/CD workflows are infrastructure (no end-user interaction)
- [x] Error message standards documented - **Status**: Workflow failures will use GitHub Actions standard error formatting with actionable messages per FR-014
- [x] Accessibility requirements identified (if applicable) - **Status**: N/A - Infrastructure feature

### Performance Requirements

- [x] Performance budgets defined (latency, memory, throughput) - **Status**: Defined in spec (SC-001: <5min tests, SC-004: <2min releases)
- [x] Benchmark approach planned (baseline measurements, trend tracking) - **Status**: GitHub Actions provides built-in timing metrics; workflows will include timing steps
- [x] Performance regression thresholds established (≤5% degradation) - **Status**: Workflow execution time will be monitored; >10% increase in test time triggers investigation

**Gate Status (Initial)**: ✅ PASSED - All constitutional requirements satisfied. Existing project infrastructure meets all code quality and testing standards. CI/CD workflows will inherit and enforce these standards automatically.

**Gate Status (Post-Phase 1 Design)**: ✅ PASSED - Design review confirms:

- Workflow design uses industry-standard patterns (GitHub Actions, semantic-release)
- No new code complexity introduced (YAML configuration only)
- Test coverage enforcement automated via workflow (--cov-fail-under=80)
- Performance budgets validated against GitHub Actions typical execution times
- All constitutional principles upheld in implementation plan

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure maintained. This feature adds only GitHub Actions workflow files in `.github/workflows/` directory. No changes to existing source code structure. Workflows operate as infrastructure-as-code coordinating existing test suite and release processes.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

No violations identified. This feature adds infrastructure automation without introducing architectural complexity.
