# Feature Specification: GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflows

**Feature Branch**: `002-github-actions-cicd`  
**Created**: October 25, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create cicd workflows utilizing github actions. PRs should be fully tested. Anything merged to main should create a github release, using automatic semantic versioning for release notes and tagging/version numbering. The release should include a compressed artifact of the bot, with all the code required for production (but none of the tests and other code not needed for runtime)."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Pull Request Quality Gate (Priority: P1)

As a developer, when I create a pull request, I want the system to automatically run all tests and validation checks so that I can verify my changes don't break existing functionality before requesting review.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the CI/CD pipeline and prevents broken code from being merged. Without automated testing on PRs, code quality cannot be ensured.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a pull request with any code change and verifying that all tests execute automatically and results are reported back to the PR interface.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has made changes to the codebase, **When** they create a pull request, **Then** all automated tests execute within 5 minutes
2. **Given** a pull request is created, **When** tests are running, **Then** the PR status shows "checks in progress"
3. **Given** all tests pass, **When** test execution completes, **Then** the PR shows a green checkmark with "All checks passed"
4. **Given** any test fails, **When** test execution completes, **Then** the PR is blocked from merging and shows which tests failed
5. **Given** test coverage is below 80%, **When** coverage check runs, **Then** the PR is blocked from merging with a coverage failure message

### User Story 2 - Automated Release Creation (Priority: P2)

As a project maintainer, when code is merged to the main branch, I want the system to automatically create a tagged release with semantic versioning so that each production deployment is properly versioned and documented without manual effort.

**Why this priority**: Automates release management and ensures consistent versioning, but depends on P1 (PR testing) being in place first to ensure only tested code reaches main.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by merging a PR to main and verifying that a new GitHub release is created with correct semantic version number and auto-generated release notes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PR is merged to main, **When** the merge completes, **Then** a new release is created within 2 minutes
2. **Given** the previous version was 1.2.3 and commits contain "feat:" prefix, **When** release is created, **Then** version is bumped to 1.3.0 (minor version)
3. **Given** the previous version was 1.2.3 and commits contain "fix:" prefix, **When** release is created, **Then** version is bumped to 1.2.4 (patch version)
4. **Given** the previous version was 1.2.3 and commits contain "BREAKING CHANGE:" or "feat!:", **When** release is created, **Then** version is bumped to 2.0.0 (major version)
5. **Given** multiple commits are merged, **When** release notes are generated, **Then** they are grouped by type (Features, Bug Fixes, etc.) and list all changes

---

### User Story 3 - Production-Ready Artifact Distribution (Priority: P3)

As a deployment engineer, when a release is created, I want a compressed artifact containing only production code so that I can deploy the bot efficiently without including test files or development dependencies.

**Why this priority**: Optimizes deployment size and removes unnecessary files from production, but is less critical than ensuring code quality (P1) and release automation (P2).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by downloading the release artifact and verifying it contains src/ and required runtime files but excludes tests/ and development-only files.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a release is created, **When** artifact generation runs, **Then** a .tar.gz or .zip file is attached to the release
2. **Given** the artifact is downloaded, **When** contents are inspected, **Then** it includes src/, requirements.txt, .env.example, and README.md
3. **Given** the artifact is downloaded, **When** contents are inspected, **Then** it excludes tests/, .pytest_cache/, htmlcov/, and development dependencies
4. **Given** the artifact is extracted, **When** production dependencies are installed, **Then** the bot can start without errors
5. **Given** artifact size before and after optimization, **When** compared, **Then** production artifact is at least 30% smaller than full repository

### Edge Cases

- What happens when GitHub Actions quota is exceeded during test execution?
- How does the system handle test execution timeout (tests running longer than expected)?
- What happens if two PRs are merged to main simultaneously?
- How does the system behave if release creation fails mid-process (e.g., network error)?
- What happens when semantic versioning cannot determine version bump (non-conventional commits)?
- How does the system handle the very first release when no previous version exists?
- What happens if the release artifact upload fails?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST execute all automated tests (unit and integration) on every pull request before merge is allowed
- **FR-002**: System MUST block PR merging if any test fails or test coverage drops below 80%
- **FR-003**: System MUST display test results directly in the PR interface with clear pass/fail status
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically create a GitHub release when code is merged to main branch
- **FR-005**: System MUST determine version number using semantic versioning based on conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, BREAKING CHANGE:, etc.)
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate release notes automatically by parsing commit messages and grouping by type
- **FR-007**: System MUST create a compressed artifact (tar.gz or zip) attached to each release
- **FR-008**: Artifact MUST include all production-required files: source code, runtime dependencies, configuration templates, and documentation
- **FR-009**: Artifact MUST exclude test files, test dependencies, development tools, cache directories, and IDE configuration
- **FR-010**: System MUST tag releases with semantic version numbers (e.g., v1.2.3)
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve test execution logs for failed builds for at least 90 days
- **FR-012**: System MUST execute tests in an isolated environment matching production Python version (3.14+)
- **FR-013**: System MUST fail fast - stop test execution on first critical failure to save resources
- **FR-014**: System MUST notify developers when their PR checks fail with actionable error messages
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle the very first release (v1.0.0) when no previous release exists

### Key Entities

- **Test Run**: Represents execution of the test suite for a PR, includes status (pending/success/failure), duration, coverage percentage, failed test list
- **Release**: Represents a versioned release of the bot, includes version number, release notes, artifact download URL, creation timestamp
- **Artifact**: Compressed package of production-ready code, includes file list, size, compression format, checksum for integrity verification
- **Version**: Semantic version number, includes major/minor/patch components, determines upgrade compatibility

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers receive test results within 5 minutes of creating or updating a pull request
- **SC-002**: 100% of PRs execute full test suite before merge is allowed
- **SC-003**: Zero instances of broken code merged to main due to bypassed tests in first 3 months
- **SC-004**: Releases are created automatically within 2 minutes of merging to main
- **SC-005**: 100% of releases use correct semantic versioning based on commit messages
- **SC-006**: Production artifacts are 30-50% smaller than full repository size
- **SC-007**: Releases can be deployed to production in under 5 minutes using provided artifact
- **SC-008**: Release notes are human-readable and accurately reflect all changes in the release
- **SC-009**: Test failures provide actionable error messages that developers can resolve within 15 minutes
- **SC-010**: CI/CD pipeline has 99% uptime (excluding GitHub Actions platform issues)
