# Feature Specification: Discord Trivia Bot

**Feature Branch**: `001-discord-trivia-bot`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a discord bot that will take user input from slash commands. It will allow users to give answers to a question - if a user answers multiple times, it should tell them 'You've already answered this question - updating your answer!' and update the answer with the new one. There should be admin slash commands for listing all answers given with the user names who gave them, and resetting the list. There is no need to persist data for longer than the current trivia session, which will most likely be 1 day, but could be a few days. This solution should optimize on hosting cost - using minimal resources, and minimal storage requirements. We should include a hosting recommendation."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Submit Trivia Answer (Priority: P1)

A trivia participant uses a slash command to submit their answer to the current trivia question. The bot accepts the answer and confirms submission. If the participant submits again, the bot notifies them that their previous answer is being updated and stores the new answer.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without answer submission, there is no trivia bot. This represents the primary user interaction and must work before any other features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a user run the answer submission command, verifying the confirmation message, then submitting again and verifying the "updating your answer" message appears. No admin features or session management needed to validate this works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a trivia question is active, **When** a user runs `/answer [their response]`, **Then** the bot confirms their answer was recorded with a message like "Your answer has been recorded!"
2. **Given** a user has already submitted an answer, **When** they run `/answer [new response]`, **Then** the bot displays "You've already answered this question - updating your answer!" and replaces their previous answer with the new one
3. **Given** a user submits an answer, **When** they submit the exact same answer again, **Then** the bot still shows the update message and keeps their answer unchanged

### User Story 2 - View All Answers (Priority: P2)

A trivia administrator uses a slash command to view all submitted answers along with the Discord usernames of participants. This allows the admin to review responses, determine correct answers, and manage the trivia session.

**Why this priority**: Once answers are collected (P1), admins need a way to see them. This is the second-most critical feature as it enables the admin to actually run the trivia game. However, the bot has value even without this if users can submit answers.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having multiple users submit answers via the P1 feature, then having an admin run the list command and verify all answers and usernames appear correctly formatted. Does not require session reset functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple users have submitted answers, **When** an admin runs `/list-answers`, **Then** the bot displays all answers with corresponding usernames in a readable format
2. **Given** no users have submitted answers yet, **When** an admin runs `/list-answers`, **Then** the bot displays "No answers submitted yet"
3. **Given** some users have updated their answers, **When** an admin runs `/list-answers`, **Then** only the most recent answer for each user is shown

---

### User Story 3 - Reset Trivia Session (Priority: P3)

A trivia administrator uses a slash command to clear all submitted answers, starting a fresh trivia session. This allows moving to the next question or restarting the game without redeploying the bot.

**Why this priority**: This is a convenience feature that makes running multiple trivia rounds easier, but the bot is functional without it. Admins could restart the bot manually if needed, or the session could naturally expire after the configured time period.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having users submit answers (P1), verifying they're visible (P2), then having an admin run the reset command and verifying that the answer list is now empty. Each reset starts a completely fresh session.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** users have submitted answers, **When** an admin runs `/reset-answers`, **Then** all stored answers are cleared and the bot confirms "All answers have been reset - ready for next question!"
2. **Given** answers have been reset, **When** an admin runs `/list-answers`, **Then** the bot shows "No answers submitted yet"
3. **Given** answers have been reset, **When** users submit new answers, **Then** they are accepted without any reference to previous answers

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to submit an empty answer?
- What happens when a non-admin tries to run admin commands (`/list-answers`, `/reset-answers`)?
- How does the system handle very long answer text (e.g., 2000+ characters)?
- What happens if multiple admins try to reset answers simultaneously?
- How does the bot behave if Discord is experiencing latency or the command times out?
- What happens when a user leaves the server after submitting an answer?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a `/answer` slash command that accepts user input and stores it with the user's Discord identity
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect when a user has already submitted an answer and display the message "You've already answered this question - updating your answer!"
- **FR-003**: System MUST replace a user's previous answer with their new answer when they submit multiple times
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a `/list-answers` slash command that displays all submitted answers with corresponding Discord usernames
- **FR-005**: System MUST restrict the `/list-answers` command to users with administrator permissions in the Discord server
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a `/reset-answers` slash command that clears all stored answers
- **FR-007**: System MUST restrict the `/reset-answers` command to users with administrator permissions in the Discord server
- **FR-008**: System MUST store answers in memory only (no persistent database) to minimize hosting costs
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle answer text up to Discord's slash command response limit (4000 characters)
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear error messages when non-admin users attempt admin commands
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide clear feedback messages for all successful operations (answer submitted, answers listed, answers reset)
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate that answer submissions contain non-empty text

### Key Entities

- **Answer**: Represents a user's response to a trivia question, containing the answer text, Discord user ID, Discord username, and submission timestamp
- **Trivia Session**: Represents the current active trivia round, containing all submitted answers for the current question; automatically created when first answer is submitted and cleared on reset

### Assumptions

- Discord bot will be registered with appropriate slash command permissions before deployment
- Server administrators will grant the bot role permissions to manage slash commands
- Admin permissions are defined by Discord's built-in server permission system
- Answer data persists only for the bot's runtime - if the bot restarts, all data is lost
- Sessions naturally expire when the bot is restarted or after configured memory cleanup
- A single active trivia question exists at a time (no multi-question management needed)
- The bot operates in one Discord server at a time, or maintains separate session state per server if multi-server

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can submit a trivia answer and receive confirmation within 2 seconds
- **SC-002**: Users who submit multiple answers see the "updating your answer" message and have only their latest answer stored
- **SC-003**: Admins can view all submitted answers with usernames in a single command response
- **SC-004**: The bot handles 100 concurrent answer submissions without response delays exceeding 3 seconds
- **SC-005**: Non-admin users receive a clear permission error when attempting admin commands
- **SC-006**: Bot hosting costs remain under $5/month for typical usage (up to 50 active users per session)
- **SC-007**: Bot memory usage stays under 100MB during active trivia sessions with up to 100 participants
- **SC-008**: 95% of users successfully submit their first answer on the first attempt without errors
- **SC-009**: Answer reset operation completes within 1 second and confirmation is visible to the admin
- **SC-010**: Bot responds to all slash commands within Discord's 3-second interaction timeout window

### Hosting Recommendation Criteria

The hosting solution MUST meet these requirements:

- Support for running lightweight, always-on services
- Memory allocation of at least 128MB
- Network connectivity for Discord API access
- Cost under $5/month for the specified usage levels
- Minimal setup and maintenance overhead
