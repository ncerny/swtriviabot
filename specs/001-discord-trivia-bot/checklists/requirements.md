# Specification Quality Checklist: Discord Trivia Bot

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items validated successfully:

### Content Quality Review

- Specification focuses on Discord bot behavior, slash commands, and user interactions (WHAT/WHY)
- No specific technologies, frameworks, or programming languages mentioned
- Written in plain language understandable by non-technical trivia hosts
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Review

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements use reasonable defaults
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by executing /answer command)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (2 seconds, 100 concurrent users, $5/month, 95% success rate)
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of specific hosting platforms, programming languages)
- Each user story has 3+ acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases section covers boundary conditions (empty answers, permission errors, long text, concurrent operations)
- Scope clearly defined: answer submission, admin review, session reset - no multi-question tracking
- Assumptions documented (Discord permissions, single-server operation, in-memory storage)

### Feature Readiness Review

- Functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios (FR-001 → US1 acceptance scenarios)
- User scenarios cover the complete workflow: submit answer (P1) → view answers (P2) → reset session (P3)
- Success criteria quantify expected outcomes from all user stories
- Specification maintains abstraction - hosting recommendation is requirements-based, not prescriptive

## Notes

No issues found. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.
